## About
"Tomorrow" is a song by Australian rock band Silverchair, which was released on 16 September 1994 on their debut EP, also titled Tomorrow. The song was re-recorded and included on Frogstomp, the band's debut studio album, released six months later on 27 March 1995. Written by singer and lead guitarist Daniel Johns and drummer Ben Gillies, it was produced and engineered by Phil McKellar at the national radio station Triple J's studios for SBS-TV's show Nomad, which aired on 16 June 1994. After the broadcast, Silverchair were signed to the Murmur record label – a Sony Music subsidiary – which subsequently issued the Tomorrow EP.
