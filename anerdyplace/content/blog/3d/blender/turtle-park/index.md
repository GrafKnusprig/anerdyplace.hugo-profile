for the 3d scan i used the app realitiy scan
its free but your files are public
photogrammetry
you can download the scan as glb file, blender works fine with that, even includes uv mappings

import into blender and bring to scale:
measure 2 points where you did real world measurements
calculate scale factor:

$$ \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Real Distance}}{\text{Blender Measured Distance}} $$

some first ideas:
