      When you ask someone to tell you about themselves, it's never easy.

      I've been interested in all sorts of things all my life and my interests are constantly changing. I live to evolve and discover new joys in life.
      If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be that I am an artist.

      After school, I studied computer science and now have over 10 years of professional experience as a full stack software engineer.

      Since one skill alone does not satisfy me, I have many hobbies.
      I enjoy personalizing everything in my life, adapting things and processes to my needs.
      Here I can live out my creativity to the full.

      My passions also include art and music. I often do small favors for my friends. Whether it's 3D models, logos, programs, websites, videos or photoshoots... the list is truly endless.

      Whenever possible, I make my designs and programs open source. I'm a big advocate of that.

      <br>

      On this website I want to give an overview of my projects. Unfortunately, I can't keep up with posting everything I do here. But I'll try to post something from time to time.
