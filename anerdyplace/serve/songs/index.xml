Written by frontman Chris Cornell, the song was released in May 1994 by A&amp;amp;M Records as the third single from the band&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album, Superunknown (1994). Considered to be the band&amp;rsquo;s signature song, it topped the US Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart, where it spent a total of seven weeks at number one. Despite peaking at number two on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, &amp;ldquo;Black Hole Sun&amp;rdquo; finished as the number-one track of 1994 for that listing. Worldwide, the single reached the top 10 in Australia, Canada, France, and Ireland, while in Iceland, it reached number one. The accompanying music video was directed by Howard Greenhalgh and received the award for Best Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_Sun&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
