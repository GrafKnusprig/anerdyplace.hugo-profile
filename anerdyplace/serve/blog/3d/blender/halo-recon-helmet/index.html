<p>..was creepy.</p>
<h2 id="it-all-started">It all started</h2>
<p>with me getting into cosplay. Cosplay was always the thing I did know existed, but wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to think of it. Until I got invited to a convention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone all out and built a whole plate armor for my girlfriend. She cosplayed Erza from fairy tail.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="erza-armor.webp" alt="image of erza armor"  />
</p></p>
<p>I made it all from EVA foam, Arylic paint and Latex. With the simplest tools: A cutter knife and a dremel.</p>
<p>I also made Erzas winged sword. Totally LARP conform. With a fiber glass rod in the middle, enough cusion and a soft tip.
That way we could take it inside and run around the convention without getting any problems at all.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="erza-sword-plain.webp" alt="image of erzas sword"  />
</p></p>
<p>I did go as Mystogan. My girlfriend made the clothing and I made all his staffs.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="mystogan.webp" alt="image of mystogan"  />
</p></p>
<p>It was fun and I got tons of compliments for my builds, which pushed me good and was great for my ego. :D</p>
<p>We went to another convention not long after that and there I saw some guys with halo mjolnir suits.
And I thought to myself: why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?
It is my most favorite game of all time and reminds me of my childhood.</p>
<p>So the plan was settled.</p>
<h2 id="i-always-wanted-a-3d-printer">I always wanted a 3D printer</h2>
<p>and now I had the excuse to buy one. I wanted to build my own mjolnir and I wanted to print it myself.</p>
<p>I decided to do the Recon Armor, since I didn&rsquo;t want to look the same as everyone else and I always liked the looks of it in Halo multiplayer.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="halo-reach-recon.webp" alt="image of recon"  />
</p></p>
<p>The Ender 3 Pro was on sale for 160€, so I gave it a shot.
It arrived 2 days after and the assembly was easy and intuitive. I totally can recommend this printer, since it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I made sure to assemble everything to the best. I mesured all the party, made all the angles perfect 90°, I modified the z-achsis holder and drilled a few new holes, so that I could adjust the x-achsis to my liking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I make a complete post about just that.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had no experience, but the PLA printed fine. But I wanted my cosplay parts to be more durable, excpecially in a car during the summer. So I ordered some PETG.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that easy at first, but I got it to work. The stringing was less of a problem, more was the adhesion of the print to the stock printbed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will also inlclude this in the other post.</p></blockquote>
<p>I figured that it&rsquo;s mainly the setup of the printer that decides over how the prints turn out and less the settings of the slicer.</p>
<h2 id="i-got-the-helmet">I got the helmet</h2>
<p>model from thingiverse. It was a happy coincidence, that someone made the exact helmet I wanted to print as a 3D model.</p>
<p>But it wasnt perfect. It clearly wasn&rsquo;t meant as a helmet you could really wear on your head.
So I had to to some tweaks to make it work.</p>
<p>I removed the bottom and added some thickness to the model.</p>
<!-- ![image of the helmet stl](/blog/3d/blender/halo-recon-helmet/helmet-on-head2.webp) -->
<p>I wanted it to fit perfect on my head and I didn&rsquo;t want to make any testprints or produce any waste at all.</p>
<p>So I had to come up with an idea. It was so simple as it was complicated :D</p>
<p>I would just model my own head in blender and then fit the helmet virtually.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="helmet-on-head2.webp" alt="image of my head in blender"  />
</p></p>
<p>I started by measuring my own head with some measuring tape and took a note of all the values.</p>
<p>I blender I used an add-on to get a generic head model.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="helmet-on-head.webp" alt="image of my head in blender"  />
</p></p>
<p>From there on I tweaked it to my size.
For an even more accurate model I took some pictures of my head and imported them into blender, too.</p>
<p>This was all pretty new to me and I didn&rsquo;t really have any blender experience, so it took a while.</p>
<p>But I eventually got it right and started to fit the helmet.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-problem">The next problem</h2>
<p>occured, when I found out, that I cannot just pull of the helmet from my head. Because it was narrower at the bottom and PETG is not flexible at all.</p>
<p>I fixed this problem with a hinge mechanism on the back of the helmet. So the back can just flip open, my head can slip in and the helmet can close back up again.</p>
<p>My solution was to put on some magnets to secure the mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="i-was-happy">I was happy</h2>
<p>and imported the thing in Cura&hellip;</p>
<p>..where the next problem was just around the corner.</p>
<p>Of course the print didn&rsquo;t fit inside the 220x220x200mm print space of the Ender 3.</p>
<p>I had to slice it up.</p>
<h2 id="back-in-blender">Back in Blender</h2>
<p>I used some cubes and boolean modifiers to slice the helmet in I believe 13 different pieces. I looked for a way to slice it, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to use any supports for the print.</p>
<p>And I did a pretty good job in doing so.</p>
<h2 id="now-i-was-ready">Now I was ready</h2>
<p>to print.</p>
<p>I started with a 0.6mm nozzle, since this reduced the print time for one piece from 14 to 9 hours. And I printed the first piece.</p>
<p>After it was finished, I didn&rsquo;t like the finish of the part. The details where to washed out because of the 0.6mm nozzle, so I swapped it for a 0.4mm.</p>
<p>Since I printed all my parts over night, it wasn&rsquo;t that much of a big deal, that the prints took a little bit longer. The details were worth it.</p>
<p>I printed all the parts without a single one failing on me. Which suprised me a lot.</p>
<h2 id="after-everything-was-printed">After everything was printed</h2>
<p>and ready for the assembly, I found another little problem. The prints didn&rsquo;t align 100%. That is, because my printer wasn&rsquo;t assembled with all 90° angles, but ever so slightly off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was a big reveal for all my future print, because I recalibrated my hole printer and since then it prints perfectly.<br><br>
Prints often look better right of the bed of my Ender 3 than the ones from my friends CR10.<br><br>
And that&rsquo;s huge if you consider the prince difference. But you have to put a litte more time into perfecting the Ender 3.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem of the slight missalignment wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal. After glueing everything together with CA glue, I could fill up the very small gaps with some car body filler and sand it down to a nice finish.</p>
<h2 id="the-moment-of-truth">The moment of truth</h2>
<p>was when I tried to put on the helmet for the first time.</p>
<p>Long story short: It was a perfect fit at first try and it looks amazing.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="helmet.webp" alt="image of helmet"  />
</p></p>
<h2 id="the-last-thing-i-did">The last thing I did</h2>
<p>was to add the LED lights to the helmet.
I used an Arduino Pro Micro, a 9V battery and some adressable LEDs.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="helmet-with-led.webp" alt="image of helmet"  />
</p></p>
<p>With a switch in the back, you can choose from bright white light, dimmed yellow light, grenn blinking (mainly for cosplay conventions to get some attention) and a police car red blue blinking pattern.</p>
<p>The last one was a bit of work since I had to watch some police car footage to find out about the right pattern of the colors and the blinking. But it turned out really well.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work:</h2>
<p>It was winter, so for the paint job I wanted to wait until the days get warmer and I can paint it outside.</p>
<p>In the meantime I started with the body armor of the suit and finished the first piece.</p>
<p>It all came to an apprupt stop, because of some problems in my life and I wasn&rsquo;t able to finish it yet.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.</p>
