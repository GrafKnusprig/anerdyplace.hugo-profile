Well design is a little far-fetched. I just put a few parts together and called it a music player. :D\nThe first iteration In the first iteration I tried my headphones directly on the PCM5102 and they sounded amazing and loud enough for my taste. But something felt off using headphones directly on a DAC preamp.\nI did a little research and found out, that the PCM5102 is designed for low-current and high-impedance loads, like that of amplifiers. Not the low impedance and current-hungry nature of headphones. Talking 16-80 ohms headphones.\nI figured, that it also could damage the DAC or my headphones in the long run.\nThe second iteration I almost immediately went down to work and cracked the glued and beautifully painted housing open again. This hurt real bad\u0026hellip;\nI had a MAX4410 laying around from another project.\nNew goals The goals for the second iteration were:\nrework the complete layout of the components remove the micro-usb port for charging and use the usb-c of the esp to both charge and program the player integrate the MAX4410 without making the overall footprint bigger use the switched pot of the max as the power button Work\u0026hellip; So I removed everything. The switch, the buttons, all the wires, the modules. I started over again. Moved all the components to new places and I stuffed a lot more in there. A new step down module to power the esp, the dac, the sd card reader and the amp. Was a little worried that this would be a little much for the small esp ldo. I also added a mode button, so 3 buttons in the new version. And I added a neopixel to show the modes with different colors.\nThe headphone jacks of the dac and amp got removed to reduce their size and I soldered one of them directly to the pcb.\nThe traces of the volume pot on the amp were cut, and I placed it between the charger module\u0026rsquo;s 5V and the buck converter. So it can switch the whole player.\nIt was a success and I\u0026rsquo;m pleased that the whole thing really didn\u0026rsquo;t become much bigger.\na lot of new cables\u0026hellip;\nthe finished thing\nMore flaws I found out that the MAX4410 sounds like a good idea on paper, but it’s not really made for full-blown line-level signals like the PCM5102 puts out.\nIt ends up being way too loud, with barely any control over the volume. I had to set the gain to 0.05 on the software side, which is a very bad idea, because this throws most of the PCM5102\u0026rsquo;s dynamic range out of the window\u0026hellip;\nA fix for now As the assembly and the components do not survive yet another disassembly, I will drop a simple resistor voltage divider between the DAC and the amp to reduce the input signal. That brings the volume down to something usable without losing the dynamics of the PCM5102.\nFor the next step A better fit is something like the TPA6132. It handles proper DAC output levels, drives headphones cleanly, and just plays nicer overall. This chip comes on a small module, simple and plain. Without audio jack and volume pot.\nSo I ordered a bunch of new stuff for the third iteration.\nWhat comes next? The next iteration will be smaller and again a little better. I still want to use a 18650 battery with around 3500mAh, because they are safe and I like their heft and overall look. Also their easy way of being replaced.\nI will not use a full ESP32 dev board, but a esp32 cam module. These modules come with a sd card reader on board and yet are smaller than the full dev boards. They have a separate programmer board, which is really nice.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still going to use a PCM5102 as dac, I like them for their low noise level and high dynamic range.\nA TPA6132 is going to be used as the headphone amp, with a stereo volume pot in between the dac and the amp.\nI also found nice charging boards for the 18650 batteries with usb-c ports and I will combine them with fixed 5V to 3.3V step down converters. I played with the idea of skipping the boost and buck steps and using a buck directly on the 3.7V battery, but most of them - especially the small ones - need at least a 1V difference to work. So from 3.7V to 3.3V is not going to work for now. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there is a way, but I need a little more research for that.\n","tags":["music","mp3","flac","wav","player","esp32","programming","audio"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1748285220", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/esp/esp32-music-player/", "title":"ESP32 music player", "summary":"ESPod - Shuffle instant music - free of distractions\nno boot time, no menus, no bullshit!\n❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\nthe front side with cute ghosts\nand the back side with a little, cute turtle\nYes it\u0026rsquo;s true I built an ESP32 based music player that can play mp3, wav and flac!\nWell, flac is more a proof of concept, including stutters and lags.

But the rest works exceptionally well!\nI was totally surprised by the music quality this \u0026rsquo;little\u0026rsquo; thing can deliver.\nWhat was my goal? I wanted a super simple, high quality, beefy music player that could take a punch and had a good feel to it.\nIt also should act like an oldschool cassette walkman! Press play and the music starts where you left of last time - stop and throw it in the bag.\nSo buttons with a good haptic feel were crucial.\nI think I achieved my goal. A big and snappy button starts the player and music is playing in an instant. A bookmark is saved every second, so when you turn the player off and then on again, it continues exactly where you stopped listening.\nThe parts For this project I used:\nESP32 WROOM Dev Board PCM5102 Modul DAC I2S Generic SD card module 134N3P 5V step-up power module 18650 battery 2 buttons 1 beefy on/off switch the heart: the PCM5102\nWhy? I recently did a project at work with ESP32s and I kind of fell in love with them, so I ordered a bunch without knowing what to do with them - then came this project. :)\nThe PCM5102 I did order for another project. I built a few Icecast receivers for a silent disco, but then switched to snapcast. As this was too much to handle for an ESP, I used Raspberries with USB audio-interfaces for this project and was left with this nice DACs. The audio quality is amazing! I really did not expect that depth and clearity from that little module.\nThe SD module is self explanatory. It\u0026rsquo;s used to read the music from an SD card.\nThe 18650s I savaged from old notebook batteries. I really love upcycling stuff. \u0026lt;3\nFor powering the whole thing and for charging the battery, I use the very simple 134N3P. It\u0026rsquo;s designed with 18650 batteries in mind and gets the job done quite well.\nThe code Oh boy the code\u0026hellip; it was a nightmare.\nAs always, you can find the complete code of this project on my github: esp32mp3\nFeel free to do what ever you want with this :D\nI used the ESP8266Audio library and got the first results pretty fast. After only 5 minutes with ChatGPT (more about this later) I had the first audio files playing on my headphones and I was stunned! The resolution of the sound was extraordinary! I later found out, that the PCM5102 is one of the higher end modules for audio and loved by the community.\nThat was where the journey began\u0026hellip;\nA week of agony So listen up. This section is important and can prevent you from running into the same problems!\nAfter the first baby steps I continued to build a full on audio workhorse with the help of ChatGPT - better use that pro subscription! I very soon ran into strange and non-deterministic problems. Sometimes everything worked and some other times the esp crashed with an Guru Meditation error or access violation completely out of nowhere.\nThe code that ChatGPT provided was simple and I thought that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with it.\n// if a track is running -\u0026gt; close it if (mp3.isRunning()) mp3.stop(); if (wav.isRunning()) wav.stop(); if (flac.isRunning()) flac.stop(); fileSrc.close(); //... // then start the new track if (path.endsWith(\u0026#34;.mp3\u0026#34;) || path.endsWith(\u0026#34;.MP3\u0026#34;)) { currentType = TYPE_MP3; if (off) fileSrc.seek(off, SEEK_SET); mp3.begin(\u0026amp;fileSrc, \u0026amp;audioOut); isPlaying = mp3.isRunning(); } //... same for the other file types The functions A quick overview over the functionality of the player. We need that to go on.\nvolume up - press the up botton once\nvolume down - press the down button once\nnext track - hold the up button\nprevious track - hold the down button\nin the first attempt there were 2 modes:\nshuffle all shuffles all songs on the sd card shuffle folder shuffles only the songs of the current folder the 2 modes can be switched by pressing and holding both buttons you can skip to the next folder by shortly pressing both buttons Back to the agony \u0026hellip; Sometimes the ESP didn\u0026rsquo;t crash for 10 songs, then it crashed every time you skipped to the next song.\nHours and hours I spent together with ChatGPT trying to solve the problem. I added locks, memory-saving methods, checked the heap, and used mutexes to regulate read and write access to the SD card. All without success.\nThen it dawned on me. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that I had forgotten how to code—the problem was ChatGPT itself. It kept going in circles, making the code more and more complex and convoluted, and nothing made sense anymore. The errors piled up and nothing worked as it should. At that point, I was ready to give up on the project entirely. But then I decided to start over from scratch and tackle the problem myself.\nThe only thing I kept from ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s logic was accessing the SD card using a mutex. That actually made sense. Everything else I solved the conventional way: I read documentation and looked at examples. It turned out that you have to handle the library a bit differently:\n// Stop any running decoder and cleanup if (mp3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mp3-\u0026gt;isRunning()) { mp3-\u0026gt;stop(); delete mp3; mp3 = nullptr; } if (wav \u0026amp;\u0026amp; wav-\u0026gt;isRunning()) { wav-\u0026gt;stop(); delete wav; wav = nullptr; } if (flac \u0026amp;\u0026amp; flac-\u0026gt;isRunning()) { flac-\u0026gt;stop(); delete flac; flac = nullptr; } if (fileSrc) { fileSrc-\u0026gt;close(); delete fileSrc; fileSrc = nullptr; } //... if (currentPath.endsWith(\u0026#34;.mp3\u0026#34;) || currentPath.endsWith(\u0026#34;.MP3\u0026#34;)) { currentIdx = idx; currentType = TYPE_MP3; if (off == 0) { uint32_t skipped = skipID3v2Tag(fileSrc); LOG(\u0026#34;Skipped %u bytes of ID3v2 tag\\n\u0026#34;, skipped); } else { fileSrc-\u0026gt;seek(off, SEEK_SET); } mp3 = new AudioGeneratorMP3(); mp3-\u0026gt;begin(fileSrc, audioOut); } Can you spot the difference?\nTechnical Comparison: Object vs. Pointer-Based Implementation In the initial code, decoder objects like mp3, wav, and flac are used as stack-allocated objects (not pointers). Methods such as mp3.isRunning() and mp3.stop() are called directly on these objects, and there is no explicit memory management—objects are created and destroyed automatically as their scope changes.\nIn contrast, the improved code uses pointers for all decoder objects and the file source. For example, mp3, wav, flac, and fileSrc are all pointers. This approach allows for dynamic allocation (new) and explicit deallocation (delete) of resources. Before starting a new track, the code checks if a decoder exists and is running, stops it, deletes the object, and sets the pointer to nullptr. This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up and avoids memory leaks or dangling references.\nAnother problem was that some mp3s took an eternity to start playing. After a little testing and researching I found out, that this was probably due to the mp3 tags in the files.\nI stumbled upon this nice little method to skip those tags in a very elegant and fast way:\nuint32_t skipID3v2Tag(AudioFileSource *src) { char header[10]; if (src-\u0026gt;read((uint8_t *)header, 10) != 10) return 0; if (memcmp(header, \u0026#34;ID3\u0026#34;, 3) != 0) { src-\u0026gt;seek(0, SEEK_SET); // not an ID3v2 tag return 0; } uint32_t tagSize = ((header[6] \u0026amp; 0x7F) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 21) | ((header[7] \u0026amp; 0x7F) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 14) | ((header[8] \u0026amp; 0x7F) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 7) | (header[9] \u0026amp; 0x7F); uint32_t skipBytes = tagSize + 10; // +10 header src-\u0026gt;seek(skipBytes, SEEK_SET); return skipBytes; } This works like a charm! The tags are now skipped in a few ms instead of 30 seconds.\nThis was the final change that made the player what I intended it to be.\nA digital music player that behaves like an old-school cassette player! Turn the switch on and music starts playing instantly! No boot time, no screen, no menus. Just music without distraction.\nFinish line This change made all the difference. Finally, everything ran smoothly. There are still occasional crashes that I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully tracked down yet, but they\u0026rsquo;re mostly a thing of the past. Most of the time, the player now runs stably.\nA nice case Of course, the player also needed a nice home. This time, I tried a new approach. I scanned the whole thing in 3D using the RealityScan app and then imported the model into Blender.\nI then quickly and roughly recreated the scan with simple objects like cubes and cylinders. I made sure to model all the openings to the outside in an \u0026rsquo;exaggerated\u0026rsquo; way so that I would end up with an actual opening.\nAfter that, I surrounded the whole thing with a large cuboid and subtracted the inside from the outside.\nThe result was a quick and very precisely fitting case that fit perfectly after printing the first time :) Just the way I like it.\n(think twice, print once!)\nthe 3D scan of the combined modules\nthe remodeled scan\nthe finished housing\nThe End Sorry that I totally skipped the whole assembly and soldering part, the layout and PCB arrangement\u0026hellip;\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t make any images during the whole process, but I think yours will look completely different anyway :)\nHave fun!\n","tags":["music","mp3","flac","wav","player","esp32","programming","audio"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1748242020", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/projects/graffiti-bmw/", "title":"Graffiti BMW", "summary":"\u0026hellip; coming soon \u0026hellip;\n", "content":"\u0026hellip; coming soon \u0026hellip;\n","tags":["graffiti","bmw","cellshading","painting","montana","molotow","paint marker"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1740873600", "url":"https://philippraven.com/gallery/bmw-graffiti-passau/", "title":"BMW Graffiti Passau", "summary":"", "content":"","tags":["gallery","passau","bmw","graffiti","sunshine","spring",2025], "section": "gallery"},{"date":"1739664078", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/3d/minimalist-wallet/", "title":"Minimalist Wallet", "summary":"3D printed Minimalist Wallet Version 1 Version 1 was our first try.

Multicolor First Layer Approach This update gives the wallet a sleek, multicolor finish right from the first layer:\nSwappable Filaments: The cover shells allow for filament swaps, making a multicolor print possible. Clean Design: No extra edges, bridges, or structure—just pure color. Flexible Options: If you prefer a more structured look over the color effect, simply omit the colored objects and print the shells as they are. How to print multicolor Software Setup:\nUse PrusaSlicer. It supports 3MF files and lets you hide parts of your model. Slicing Process:\nLoad your 3MF file. Hide the shells and slice only the color infill. Then, hide the color infill and slice only the shell. Printing Steps:\nPrint the color infill. Swap the filament. Print the shell. Tips:\nSkip the brim or skirt to avoid interference. Keep an eye on the print bed temperature—add custom G-code if needed to prevent it from cooling too much. With an 11-minute print, manual intervention works just fine.

Lot\u0026rsquo;s of DIYers build their stuff with duct tape. But one guy pointed out, that the tape never fully dries and releases fumes over a long period of time. And he is acutally right. I store all my stuff in sealable containers. Spray paint, grease, electronics and also my sticky tapes. And I can tell you, if you open one of those boxes, a big cloud of fumes comes directly to your face and almost let you faint. 😄\nSo hot glue it was, till it is easy to work with and it hardens in the end.\nThe fans I initially wanted to install in a way that they blow the air out of the box from the top, creating a vacuum inside the box. However, when testing the fans, I noticed that they vibrate strongly in a horizontal orientation and are no longer whisper-quiet. On the other hand, when mounted vertically, they run completely quietly. To avoid unnecessarily shortening their lifespan and dealing with the humming noise, I decided to completely change my plans and install the fans vertically on one side.

Our aim is to advance AI capabilities in ornithology, contributing to broader ecological studies and conservation initiatives. Regular updates and team interactions ensure consistent progress and innovation throughout the project duration.\nThe Start First, we examined the data. 30 GB of audio files labeled and sorted into their respective folders. Our initial idea was to use a custom CNN. For this, we wanted to convert the audio files into spectrogram images and train our CNN on them.\nGood preprocessing was essential for this. We divided the audio files into 5-second chunks and applied various audio filters to them. Spectrogram images were then created from the audio chunks and saved as PNG files in the same labeled folder structure.\n\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; This is a script to preprocess audio files for the birdclef-2024 project.

Approximately 48 hours for the entire dataset. And if something didn\u0026rsquo;t work or if we wanted to fine-tune something, we would have to do it all over again. We then searched for better filtering methods and used better libraries.\nThe second pipeline was more refined:\nWe removed the high pass filter and instead cut the spectrogram image below 2kHz. We used the library noisereduce as the noise filter. Then we directly segmented and generated spectrogram images. The images were exported as squares and monochrome color. This ensures better compatibility with our models. As a cherry on top, the pipeline was parallelized. All of this reduced the preprocessing time from 48 hours to 1 hour and 10 minutes.\nThe first model We tried to implement it in tensorflow. Unfortunately, we encountered errors on the AI server provided to us. That\u0026rsquo;s why we switched to PyTorch. This was much easier to handle.\nThe model itself was nothing special. Just a few convolutional, pooling and linear layers.\nclass SimpleCNN(nn.Module): def __init__(self, num_classes): super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__() self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1) self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1) self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1) self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0) self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 * 16 * 16, 256) self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, num_classes) self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5) def forward(self, x): x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x))) x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x))) x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv3(x))) x = x.view(-1, 128 * 16 * 16) x = F.relu(self.fc1(x)) x = self.dropout(x) x = self.fc2(x) return x We just reached 48% accuracy with that. So we tried something else.\nResNet18 Was one of the less good decisions and the time would probably have been better invested elsewhere. But we see our project as a process in which you simply try out freely in all directions and see what comes out of it.\nResNet18 is unfortunately a somewhat older model that has now been replaced by faster and better models. It is a pretraind CNN model.\nIt has severall advantages:\nCan directly be applied to the Spectrogram images Fast training time Good at extracting features The initialization of the model is super easy for that:\ndef create_spectrogram_model(num_classes): model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True) num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, num_classes) model = model.to(device) return model The Hyperparameters: Batch size = 64 Epochs = 5 Learning rate = 0.0001 The Performance: TrainLoss: 1.42 ValLoss: 1.58 ValAcc: 63.40% Inception_v3 Next, we tried Inception_v3. Also a pretrained CNN model with all it\u0026rsquo;s advantages and disadvantages. Inception_v3 is also an older model, which you can see in the results.\nThe initialization is also as easy as it gets:\ninception = models.inception_v3(pretrained=True) This model gave us a slightly better performance:\nHyperparameters: Learning Rate: 0.001 Batch Size: 32 Optimizer: Adam Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss Epochs: 20 Performance: Training Loss: 0.2660 Validation Loss: 1.5370 Validation Accuracy: 73.84% ResNeXt-50: A Big Leap Now we get a little more modern\u0026hellip;\nWe then tried ResNeXt-50, which incorporates the concept of \u0026ldquo;cardinality\u0026rdquo; by performing multiple transformations in parallel.\nTraining Setup: Hyperparameter Tuning: Performed using Optuna. Epochs: 5 (early stopping applied) Learning Rate: 0.0001 Batch Size: 64 Results: Training Loss: 0.2433 Validation Loss: 1.3121 Validation Accuracy: 75.11% Validation AUC: 0.9880 This model outperformed all previous approaches in both accuracy and AUC. The use of Optuna for hyperparameter tuning proved highly beneficial in optimizing the model’s performance.\nA Failed Attempt: Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) As part of our exploration of cutting-edge models, we experimented with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). This model processes raw audio directly, bypassing the need to convert audio into spectrogram images, theoretically allowing the model to learn features directly from the audio waveforms.\nOur reasoning was that this approach could potentially outperform traditional CNN-based methods that rely on spectrogram images, especially when dealing with complex, noisy data like bird calls in natural environments. The AST, having been pre-trained on AudioSet, seemed like a promising candidate for transfer learning in this domain.\nThe Setup We initially faced issues with the .ogg file format and the 32 kHz sampling rate, as the AST model expects raw audio inputs in a different format (16 kHz). To resolve this, we employed SoX and PyDub to convert and resample the audio files. After several preprocessing attempts, we managed to create the appropriate inputs for the AST model.\nHowever, that was just the beginning of the difficulties. Upon running the model, we encountered the following cryptic error:\nAssertionError: choose a window size 400 that is [2, 1] Despite consulting the model’s documentation and even reaching out to the author on GitHub, it took multiple iterations to identify the problem: we were using the wrong feature extractor. Initially, we were working with the AST feature extractor:\nfeature_extractor = ASTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name) After trial and error, we switched to the Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor, which was more appropriate for our audio input:\nfeature_extractor = Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name) The Outcome Switching the feature extractor fixed the initial issue, but more errors followed. Each fix led to another hurdle, with error messages that were poorly documented and difficult to troubleshoot. These issues ranged from training crashes to input size mismatches. Given the tight competition deadlines and the lack of sufficient community support for AST, we reluctantly decided to abandon this approach.\nWhile the AST model holds significant potential for audio classification tasks, the implementation difficulties in our case, combined with the limited time for the competition, made it infeasible. It was a stark reminder of how early-stage models, no matter how promising, can often pose significant risks in terms of implementation time and troubleshooting.\nChallenges and Lessons Learned This project, like many in machine learning, presented several challenges that were both technical and strategic. One of the biggest hurdles was dealing with the sheer size and complexity of the dataset. Preprocessing 30 GB of audio files into spectrograms was computationally expensive, and our initial attempts took nearly 48 hours for a single attempt. Although we were able to reduce this to just over an hour through parallelization, it highlighted the importance of efficient data pipelines in large-scale machine learning projects. The lesson here is that investing time early in optimizing preprocessing steps can save significant time later on.\nAnother challenge was managing the models’ performance, particularly with older architectures like ResNet-18 and Inception v3. While these models provided moderate improvements, they were outclassed by newer architectures like ResNeXt-50. This drove home the importance of staying up to date with the latest model architectures in deep learning, as newer models often have built-in optimizations that improve performance with less tuning.\nThe failed attempt with AST also underscored the risk of diving into cutting-edge models without a deep understanding of their requirements. While AST promised better performance by working directly with raw audio, the technical issues and cryptic error messages made it clear that newer models often come with undocumented pitfalls, especially when the community support is limited.\nLastly, a key strategic challenge was managing our time and focus. Initially, we experimented widely with different architectures, which spread our efforts too thin. In hindsight, narrowing down our approach earlier and dedicating more time to fine-tuning a select few models (e.g., ResNeXt-50) could have yielded even better results. Balancing exploration with a focused strategy is a critical skill in research.\nFuture Work Moving forward, we see several opportunities to build on the progress made in this project. One clear direction is to further explore transformer-based models for audio processing. While our attempt with AST failed due to technical issues, transformers still hold significant promise. Their ability to process raw audio directly could lead to improvements in both training efficiency and classification accuracy, especially as these models evolve and more resources become available.\nWe also plan to incorporate more advanced validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation. Our current validation strategy, which involved splitting the data into training and validation sets, could be improved to give a more reliable measure of model performance. K-fold cross-validation would ensure that our models are tested on multiple subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting and providing a more robust evaluation.\nIn addition, we’re interested in exploring ways to improve the preprocessing pipeline further. While our parallelized approach significantly reduced processing time, there may be room for additional optimizations, such as experimenting with different spectrogram generation techniques or leveraging GPU-based preprocessing. Faster, more efficient preprocessing will be essential as we scale to larger datasets.\nLastly, engaging more actively with the machine learning community, especially on platforms like Kaggle, could provide new insights and collaborations. Community engagement was an area where we missed out during this project, and it’s clear that tapping into collective knowledge early on could accelerate progress, particularly when dealing with new architectures or troubleshooting errors.\n","tags":["project","birdclef","machine learning","ai","deep learning","transformer","cnn"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1717792885", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/3d/clothespin/", "title":"Clothespin", "summary":"Currently I\u0026rsquo;m having a lot of fun designing clothespins with compliant mechanisms.\nIt all started when I wanted to try FreeCAD and needed something to design.

But for more complex images, this process is hard and tedious.\nI was looking for an easier method. More controlable and planable.\nBy chance I came across the salt etching process in a Youtube video. I did not know until then that such a thing exists.\nSure, you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of electrolysis in school and done a few experiments, but to use it for etching I found very exciting.\nFor me it had the great advantage that I had everything at home.\nOf course, it is better to use the right electrolyte for the respective metal. But this is often very difficult to get and you almost have to be a chemist, or at least an enthusiastic hobbyist, to make it yourself.\nEtching with salt unfortunately produces less favorable by-products, depending on the metal, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t care about that for my little experiment.\nThe masking Masking is actually very fun and fascinating at the same time.\nSimply put, everything that is not covered by paint or anything else is etched away. So you have different possibilities to apply the design to the workpiece. I\u0026rsquo;ve often done it by painting the metal with acrylic varnish and then scratching in the design.\nHowever, if you want to use a more complex or digital design, there is a very cool trick. You can use a laser printer to print a design on thermal transfer paper in mirror image and then iron it onto the metal. The cool thing is, every catalog and brochure is actually made of this paper. And you always have something like that on hand.\nIt can be a little tricky, but with a little practice you\u0026rsquo;ll get the hang of it quickly. You have to print on a very high setting, so that the color is as dense as possible. Then take an iron on the highest setting and apply even pressure to the paper. It is advisable to put baking paper or a cloth in between. Once the paper is ironed, let it cool completely. It will stick very tightly to the metal, which is a good thing.\nNow comes the trick:\nWash the paper off the metal under running water and with a little soap. You have to be careful not to wash off the print.\nNow you can see why it\u0026rsquo;s better to use a thin catalog paper and not a thick one.\nThe etching itself is the most fun.\nYou need an insulating container, a nail or other metal part that serves as a kathode. The positive side is attached to the metal part to be etched.\nThen you have to see how much current you let flow. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly, but I think I etched at 18V and 300mA.\nIt does not take long. After a few minutes you have a result. It can easily happen that you miss the point and you etch too deep. Also, you must not etch with too much current, otherwise the paint or print can flake off very easily.\nI strongly recommend doing this outside, as the etching can produce chlorine gas and other harmful fumes.\nYou can see that the process works when the area to be etched turns brown as oxides are formed there.\nFinally one takes the workpiece out of the brine again and washes it under fresh water. The laser print and varnish residues can be removed very easily with a little acetone.\nThe last step is to polish the metal. Simply use a polish of your choice. I used Autosol metal polish.\nHave fun ;)\n","tags":["etch","salt water","metal","knife"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1681893278", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/3d/blender/halo-recon-helmet/", "title":"Halo Recon Helmet", "summary":"That one time I modelled my own head \u0026hellip; ..was creepy.\nIt all started with me getting into cosplay.

With a fiber glass rod in the middle, enough cusion and a soft tip. That way we could take it inside and run around the convention without getting any problems at all.\nI did go as Mystogan. My girlfriend made the clothing and I made all his staffs.\nIt was fun and I got tons of compliments for my builds, which pushed me good and was great for my ego. :D\nWe went to another convention not long after that and there I saw some guys with halo mjolnir suits. And I thought to myself: why didn\u0026rsquo;t I think of that? It is my most favorite game of all time and reminds me of my childhood.\nSo the plan was settled.\nI always wanted a 3D printer and now I had the excuse to buy one. I wanted to build my own mjolnir and I wanted to print it myself.\nI decided to do the Recon Armor, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to look the same as everyone else and I always liked the looks of it in Halo multiplayer.\nThe Ender 3 Pro was on sale for 160€, so I gave it a shot. It arrived 2 days after and the assembly was easy and intuitive. I totally can recommend this printer, since it\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nI made sure to assemble everything to the best. I mesured all the party, made all the angles perfect 90°, I modified the z-achsis holder and drilled a few new holes, so that I could adjust the x-achsis to my liking.\nI think I make a complete post about just that.\nI had no experience, but the PLA printed fine. But I wanted my cosplay parts to be more durable, excpecially in a car during the summer. So I ordered some PETG.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t that easy at first, but I got it to work. The stringing was less of a problem, more was the adhesion of the print to the stock printbed.\nI will also inlclude this in the other post.\nI figured that it\u0026rsquo;s mainly the setup of the printer that decides over how the prints turn out and less the settings of the slicer.\nI got the helmet model from thingiverse. It was a happy coincidence, that someone made the exact helmet I wanted to print as a 3D model.\nBut it wasnt perfect. It clearly wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant as a helmet you could really wear on your head. So I had to to some tweaks to make it work.\nI removed the bottom and added some thickness to the model.\nI wanted it to fit perfect on my head and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to make any testprints or produce any waste at all.\nSo I had to come up with an idea. It was so simple as it was complicated :D\nI would just model my own head in blender and then fit the helmet virtually.\nI started by measuring my own head with some measuring tape and took a note of all the values.\nI blender I used an add-on to get a generic head model.\nFrom there on I tweaked it to my size. For an even more accurate model I took some pictures of my head and imported them into blender, too.\nThis was all pretty new to me and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have any blender experience, so it took a while.\nBut I eventually got it right and started to fit the helmet.\nThe next problem occured, when I found out, that I cannot just pull of the helmet from my head. Because it was narrower at the bottom and PETG is not flexible at all.\nI fixed this problem with a hinge mechanism on the back of the helmet. So the back can just flip open, my head can slip in and the helmet can close back up again.\nMy solution was to put on some magnets to secure the mechanism.\nI was happy and imported the thing in Cura\u0026hellip;\n..where the next problem was just around the corner.\nOf course the print didn\u0026rsquo;t fit inside the 220x220x200mm print space of the Ender 3.\nI had to slice it up.\nBack in Blender I used some cubes and boolean modifiers to slice the helmet in I believe 13 different pieces. I looked for a way to slice it, so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to use any supports for the print.\nAnd I did a pretty good job in doing so.\nNow I was ready to print.\nI started with a 0.6mm nozzle, since this reduced the print time for one piece from 14 to 9 hours. And I printed the first piece.\nAfter it was finished, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the finish of the part. The details where to washed out because of the 0.6mm nozzle, so I swapped it for a 0.4mm.\nSince I printed all my parts over night, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much of a big deal, that the prints took a little bit longer. The details were worth it.\nI printed all the parts without a single one failing on me. Which suprised me a lot.\nAfter everything was printed and ready for the assembly, I found another little problem. The prints didn\u0026rsquo;t align 100%. That is, because my printer wasn\u0026rsquo;t assembled with all 90° angles, but ever so slightly off.\nThat was a big reveal for all my future print, because I recalibrated my hole printer and since then it prints perfectly.\nPrints often look better right of the bed of my Ender 3 than the ones from my friends CR10.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s huge if you consider the prince difference. But you have to put a litte more time into perfecting the Ender 3.\nThe problem of the slight missalignment wasn\u0026rsquo;t that big of a deal. After glueing everything together with CA glue, I could fill up the very small gaps with some car body filler and sand it down to a nice finish.\nThe moment of truth was when I tried to put on the helmet for the first time.\nLong story short: It was a perfect fit at first try and it looks amazing.\nThe last thing I did was to add the LED lights to the helmet. I used an Arduino Pro Micro, a 9V battery and some adressable LEDs.\nWith a switch in the back, you can choose from bright white light, dimmed yellow light, grenn blinking (mainly for cosplay conventions to get some attention) and a police car red blue blinking pattern.\nThe last one was a bit of work since I had to watch some police car footage to find out about the right pattern of the colors and the blinking. But it turned out really well.\nI think I could write a complete post about this topic alone. And maybe I will :)\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Future Work: It was winter, so for the paint job I wanted to wait until the days get warmer and I can paint it outside.\nIn the meantime I started with the body armor of the suit and finished the first piece.\nIt all came to an apprupt stop, because of some problems in my life and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to finish it yet.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to it.\n:)\n","tags":["3D","print","halo","cosplay","recon","helmet","arduino"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1681892574", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/3d/blender/eraser-pen/", "title":"Eraser Pen", "summary":"That one time\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;I was on my desk drawing.\nThe battery of my battery powered eraser died and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t any spare at hand.

So I thought, I model a few small things from the game and make them available to the community.\nBlood Bonds Get the Blood Bonds on thingiverse\nI started with the Blood Bonds. It\u0026rsquo;s the game\u0026rsquo;s currency for cosmetic purchases. You can buy them for real money or get them in game.\nThe Blood Bonds themselves were quite easy to construct and consist only of spheres and many boolean operations.\nI posted the thing on reddit and got very positive feedback, so I continued.\nHunt Dollars Get the Hunt Dollars on thingiverse\nThe next thing I did with the hunt dollar. This is the main currency in the game.\nI was able to use the same base as the Blood Bond, but adjusted it a bit. I drew the skulls in outline and then extruded them. The rest I did with my XPPen tablet in sculpting mode.\nThis was also very well received.\nHey Effigy Get Hey Effigy on thingiverse\nSo the next thing I did was the Weapon Charms. First, my favorite charm, Hey Effigy. A little straw doll that you can hang on your weapon in game and then it dangles around.\nThe fact that the thing ended up looking like real straw was pure coincidence. I tried around a lot. I started with particle systems and hair. Tried to comb everything into shape, but it was very idle and didn\u0026rsquo;t even really look good.\nIt looked like everything, but straw. Hair, sticks, Maccaroni, Spaghetti\u0026hellip;.\nIn the end I used Blender\u0026rsquo;s new hair system and created long, thick straws with it. Then converted these into a mesh and then used simple vertex operations to shape them.\nThe fact that it actually looked like straw in the end is due to the fact that many of the straws intersect. With a subsurface color and the Cycles render engine, the areas darken and it actually looks like straw.\nAnd as a fine bonus, it printed quite well. :)\nArrow Head Get the Arrow Head on thingiverse\nNext came the charm Arrow Head. As the name suggests, an arrowhead. The tip itself was very simple to make. A cone and enie tarpaulin. A few tweaks here and there and done. The real challenge was the cord at the top. This was the first time I really played around with geometry nodes.\nI created a node that draws 2 rotating circles around a curve and wraps them around the curve as long tubes. This worked very well. After that, I could just draw a path on the surface of the arrowhead and get the cord quite automatically.\nI put the longest time into shading here. I played a lot with the structure of the rope and watched some Youtube tutorials. In the end it came out pretty good.\nThe arrowhead and the background are procedural materials from Ducky3D, which I modified for my needs.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a very good package. You get a lot of materials and you can look up how they are made in the shader nodes and customize a lot of things yourself. Most importantly, you get a feel for what you are achieving and how.\nBut in the end I think it\u0026rsquo;s a bit expensive, because a lot of the materials are the same and there\u0026rsquo;s just always a lot of noise textures. Ducky probably needs about 2-3 minutes for a material.\n","tags":["hunt showdown","blender","miniatures","models","charms","blood bond","dollar"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1681344000", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/3d/tin-whistle/", "title":"DIY Tin Whistles | Part 1", "summary":"Some time ago\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;I started to build my own tin whistles.\nPVC It all started with simple flutes made from PVC pipes and wood.\nI made a bunch of them.

There were many more, but I gave them away to friends.\nI made the head quite simple for the PVC flutes. A wooden plug is simply inserted and then sawed off at an angle. The wind hole is made with scissors and files and the blade beveled with a file. All this can be done with the simplest household tools. Scissors, knives, saws, nail files.\nThe flutes are even easier. You just have to drill a blow hole in the top and close the tube with a plug.\nI used an online calculator (https://music.bracker.uk/Music/Whistle-Calculator.html) to calculate the hole position. Since the calculations for this are very complex, I have saved myself this effort for now. But sometime I still want to integrate it into the scad file.\nThe sound is amazingly good and reminiscent of woodwind instruments.\nThe tuning of the fluets is a bit tricky. You file the holes bigger and bigger, which makes the tone sharper. As you can imagine, it\u0026rsquo;s a one-way process. If you make a mistake, there is no way back and you have to start over. In the process, the very first thing is to start to cut the pipe to the base tone. You make it a little sharper than necessary, because the base tone is flattened by the drilling of the holes and the resulting increase of volume. You work your way up all 6 holes. One at a time.\nAluminium Over time I moved on to building them out of aluminum.\nThey sound very similar to PVC flutes, but if you change the mouthpiece a little they can also sound like trumpets. Kind of tinny.\n3D Printed And finally the last step was a very obvious one:\nI started to design my mouthpieces myself in OpenSCAD and print them with the 3D printer. As a reference I used my clarke sweetone which was my first whistle and which I like very much.\nIt has a slightly breathy sound. And as it turned out, the breathiness of a whistle comes from the placement of the windway to the blade. Place it ever so slightly from the bottom edge to the windway and it\u0026rsquo;s a very sharp and clean, almost brass instrument sound. Place it further in the windway and it make more of a wooden sound. It makes little or no difference what material the whistle is made of.\nThe terminology of a fipple is very complex indeed. So a added a lot of parameters to my scad file to be able to tweak around the setup.\nIt took me about 8 iterations until I had the design right. Now it prints perfectly and works right of the printer without any sanding or filing.\nAs for now, the blade sits right in the middle of the windway outlet. In addition, the air duct also tapers from the top to the bottom. This leads to a better playing experience, since less air is needed to play the whistle.\nThe size of the opening plays a crucial role in how loud the whistle is. In parallel to my normal mouthpiece, I have also been working on one that is very quiet. It\u0026rsquo;s still a work in progress, but the point of it is to have a quiet practice whistle that you can play late at night or in an apartment.\n","tags":["3d","openscad","tin whistle","fipple","sweetone"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1673377200", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/gaming/hunt-showdown/serpent-moon-story/", "title":"Serpent Moon Story", "summary":"Chapter 1 The Moon, in all her glory, was dying.

Chapter 4 Clipping from the Louisiana Lady\u0026rsquo;s Periodical, 1903\nAuthor: Unknown\nNewsprint 4x8 in.\nCAUTIONARY TALES FOR THE CHILD FOLK:\nBEWARE OCHENKOV\u0026rsquo;S WIDOW\nWe at the Louisiana Lady know how hard it can be to get a little rascal to stay in their bed at night or stop them from wandering too far. Give them something that will make them take pause the next time they want to stray with a tall tale sure to give them gooseflesh. This month we give you a story sure to keep your kids close to home with OCHENKOV\u0026rsquo;S WIDOW:\nDeep in the night, have you heard the wailing? The sobs and oddly pitched screams that hurts your ears and sets them ringing? Then you\u0026rsquo;ve just heard the fearsome widow for yourself! Some say that if you catch her gaze, you\u0026rsquo;ll start weeping enough to fill an empty sea. Others say she\u0026rsquo;s stronger than ten men and could rip twenty men in half with her bare hands. The latter must be true, considering her self-same responsibility for becoming a widow.\nAll the newspapers in New Orleans were full of news of Mary when her husband was found massacred, his chest raggedly open, and his heart stolen. By the time the body was discovered, Mary Ochenkov had long since disappeared, but months later something unfathomable transpired. Close to Mary\u0026rsquo;s home, there were several accounts of people hearing cries in the night. None dared find the source of the cries; none but one, who had an unfortunate close encounter and who said:\nWhen you get close to Mary her neck creaks like metal, and she lets out a wail that could make a strongman pass out. And then she comes at you with knife in hand.\nAfter that, there were many more encounters with the Widow, but few lived to tell the tale. But those few all have one thing to say. Don\u0026rsquo;t go wandering around at night, and don\u0026rsquo;t go talking to any stranger. Cause Ochenkov\u0026rsquo;s Widow might catch you and bring your heart to the brazier!\nChapter 5 Letter to Kevin Linus\nAuthor Handwriting matches that of Circe Elias\nHandwritten on a scrap of paper\nSevere fire damage; reconstructed by archivist\nKevin,\nThe roots of evil deepen, and after what I learned from Doctor John, I fear we might need to prepare ourselves for the least expected if we are to survive. Resort to means long denied. We have yet to understand the nature of this monster - that man - for the evil in him exceeds everything I know. There is still hope. Doctor John was hesitant to tell me until he consulted the bones - and even then I doubt he was certain.\nThough Chary claims his intentions are good, his actions prove otherwise. His total self-absorption and ambitions cloud his own mind, yet make him a strong-willed adversary. But even the toughest rock can be broken, and the mortal shell his soul resides in is not resistant to everything. All living things, natural or not, need something to function. For us - or rather for our primal bodies - blood is the essence of life and death, depending on the treatment. To manipulate one\u0026rsquo;s soul, we first need to crack open the shell and reach the essence.\nFor this, we need treated oleander leaves burned in high quantity at the devil\u0026rsquo;s hour - a poisonous inferno, \u0026ldquo;a hellfire\u0026rdquo; as Doctor John called it. If we burn enough herbs, the fumes can weaken him from within, though this alone can\u0026rsquo;t be enough to kill him. But at the very least, the smell of oleander will tell those who\u0026rsquo;ve taken his infernal pact that we will be triumphant, and they are not the only ones who can ravage with fire.\nBut this is where it becomes unspeakable: the treatment of oleander requires its leaves to be boiled in the blood of the pure and just, as evil can only be defeated by righteousness.\nDoctor John is reluctant to let me leave, but Cora promised to carry this letter to you.\nUntil then, be careful.\nC\nChapter 6 🔊 Wax Recording Transcript Titled \u0026ldquo;Timothy Stone\u0026rdquo;\nSome parts are unintelligible due to molding.\nNew captives arrived today, and Chary brought them again to the dirt circle where it all began. A brutal thing, the process. Long stakes driven into the eyes to keep them in place while Chary calmly covers their body in a clay he prepared. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how they live so long through it. Then it solidifies, creates a protective layer on the body while the souls \u0026ldquo;ripen\u0026rdquo;, as Chary says. It takes a few days, but once the soul is ready, the back of the clay structure slits open, like a mouth, a black crevasse, an abyss. But there\u0026rsquo;s never a trace of a body in it. And the sound those things make [Pause], it keeps me awake in the nights\u0026hellip; gives me unspeakable nightmares.\nChary says he needs those things to reach souls. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what he means, and I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to ask again. I dared ask once, and he smirked when I did. Then his face quickly changed when I asked if the boy\u0026rsquo;s company or other Hunters could also reave the souls. He looked me in the eye for a few seconds, before saying he had a plan. The next day, he gathered his lot and asked them to help those poor souls, explained that it would leave a mark somewhere on their body. If they managed get to one of his collection points with those marks, they would gain his favor and unimaginable rewards. [Chuckles] That man is a true master of manipulation.\n[Sighs] Unsurprisingly, Hunters once again gave into their greed, and now I have four hundred thirty-seven new names on my ledger. Business is booming. After all, they have no use of the name they had been called before.\n[Unintelligible]\nSo, I was right. I saw one of the boy\u0026rsquo;s followers [Unintelligible] he was speaking to that\u0026hellip; thing. A Soul Trap. After a few seconds, I could see the mark form on the back of his neck. How do they know about these structures? I don\u0026rsquo;t know what Chary plans to do, and I don\u0026rsquo;t care as long as I have more names and a hefty price for each, but I need to stay vigilant.\n[Transmission cuts off here]\nYour browser does not support the audio element.

Large wildfires have engulfed parts of the bayou. Local firefighters are unconcerned, as affected areas are of low importance. The True Crescent does not yet know the causes of these fires, but it is unlikely they are natural.\nPOULTRYMAN COMMENTS ON FIRES - Many are concerned for their land and businesses near wildfire outbreaks. But not poultryman William Moses, whose land is directly affected by the wildfires, who was seen leaving town heavily armed. The True Crescent approached him for comment. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on leaving my home, even when I\u0026rsquo;m dead and gone.

Guns were lowered and all stood in awe as they listened to Chary\u0026rsquo;s wretched screams, for Kevin\u0026rsquo;s fingers were sinking into the administrator\u0026rsquo;s skull. The smell of the burning oleander hung heavy in the air. There was no blood, only licks of flame, as Chary\u0026rsquo;s skin and bones parted like paper to make way for Kevin\u0026rsquo;s fingers. It had worked, Chary\u0026rsquo;s invulnerability was broken. The violation was absolutely maddening.\n\u0026ldquo;Let it end.\u0026rdquo; Kevin said with an eerie calm, \u0026ldquo;Let it end for both of us.\u0026rdquo;\nKevin\u0026rsquo;s request was then answered. He coughed up blood as Mary Ochenkov\u0026rsquo;s hand plunged into his back, her fingers finding purchase on his heart. Snakes creeped around her hands and twined themselves round her arm, sinking their fangs wherever they could, but she paid no attention. If she ever wanted relief - to find her sanity, be in control, get back Petr - she would have to fulfill her last task. last task.\nShe Squeezed.\nPop. The spectators couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite hear it as much as felt it. Kevin felt his own relief wash over. Ochenkov released the boy\u0026rsquo;s heart and he fell to the ground. His head, eyes wide open and a calm smile on his face, head, eyes wide open and a calm smile on his face, landed with a thud to stare at Moses. Circe cursed.\nChary, kneeling, panting, slowly erupted into a laugh of triumph. He unnaturally sprung to his feet, wafting away the plumes of oleander smoke that moments before had brought him to his knees.\n\u0026ldquo;Wonderful my girl, simply amazing!\u0026rdquo; Chary said as he grabbed Ochenkov\u0026rsquo;s blood-soaked hand. He lifted it into the air and addressed his attackers, stunned by Kevin\u0026rsquo;s death.\n\u0026ldquo;To think I was ever worried!\u0026rdquo; Chary guffawed. \u0026ldquo;No child can stop us, no moon, no Sculptor.

There was nothing but a soft glow. No pain, no Chary, no moon. Just him. He took a few cautious steps forward, testing his balance. He started walking, for minutes, days it seemed; but it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The calm washed over him.\nAnd then two silhouettes, a man and a woman. Kevi didn\u0026rsquo;t let himself hope, but he ran to them. Amelia and Robert Linus. His mother and father.\nKevin wrapped his arms around them, and they wrapped their arms around him in return. He crumpled to the ground, and they crumpled with him.\n\u0026ldquo;Is it okay now? Can I be with you again mama?\u0026rdquo; Kevin sobbed, his face flushing with every fallen tear. His crying showed what he had hidden for a while, something that, to keep going, he\u0026rsquo;d forgotten: his age.\n\u0026ldquo;My sweet baby, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo; Amelia kissed the crown of her child\u0026rsquo;s head. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s still more to do, and you\u0026rsquo;re still much too young to be here now.\u0026rdquo; Kevin looked to his mother in confusion.\n\u0026ldquo;Kevin, you have to go back.

The boy was quiet for a moment, then nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;You always told me that I have to keep my word. And I will.\u0026rdquo; With that, Kevin held his parents in a tight hug.

A system, imperfect, that keeps itself running based on a status quo that even the most wicked vowed not to break. And then one man enters, he works his way up the metaphorical ladder and nestles himself into a position at the top, just to tip it all over.\nI can scarcely say who did it first. Who started the inferno, the hellfire, the devil\u0026rsquo;s hour. There\u0026rsquo;s just too much chaos to get an accurate testimony before the fools burn themselves up. The so-called Lunar Pact, moon crazed, have been lighting fire with bundles of herb, like they\u0026rsquo;re smoking something out with the rancid smoke. The Infernal Pact are doing what they can to destroy the bodies, killed in the crossfire, building pyres that turn folks to ash.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve yet to witness all this myself, but I know that whoever caused the fires are destroying the work of future archaeologists, researchers, and academics. They\u0026rsquo;re turning history to a black void. An abyss into which many will lose their minds delving into.\nAnd all because of one man who wormed his way in. For now, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop me and my work.\nChapter 13 A letter from a stack found at Port Reeker, all identical.\nDamaged but intact with envelope, no return or recipient address, 8x 11 in.\nHello,\nYou do not know me, we haven\u0026rsquo;t met yet, but I am told we will. I hope we speak the same language. I am told you have experience with monsters and more terrible things.\nThe same things that happened where you are, they have been happening here for a while. Even though there are oceans between us. Things that can\u0026rsquo;t be explained. If my friends are to be believed it is worse here in Louisiana than anywhere else. And it\u0026rsquo;s spreading, there are rumors, and spreading.\nThe American Hunters Association want to keep this to themselves. But they\u0026rsquo;re losing control, and if someone else doesn\u0026rsquo;t step in, we\u0026rsquo;re all goners.\nI know you have no reason to care. I know you have no reason to help. But if even a small part of you wants to come to New Orleans, please follow it. We are a small group, but we are growing, and I promise we\u0026rsquo;ll do anything we can to repay your kindness.\nWhen you call for me, I will answer. When you are ready, I will be waiting.\nMay her light keep you,\nLinus\nChapter 14 Poster, \u0026ldquo;TO THE AHA: THE CORRESPONDENCE OF EL WOOD FINCH\u0026rdquo;\nLetter pressed, 12x18 in.\nTo all Hunters,\nIt is with great sadness that the Louisiana branch of the American Hunters Association can no longer sustain itself. Though it may outlive me, not for long. There are those that would see the Sculptor thrive in our home. Our administration cannot respond to correspondence at this time, we must take action against those terrorizing our group.\nIt is no secret that our influence has been waning: others are paying bounties, providing arms, and have their own beliefs. This chaos has allowed the problem to fester. And now these damned Pacts are holding more sway. There is one consolation: they too will soon burn out.\nRepresentatives from both eastern and western branches have been called to lend their strength against those who seek to undermine our mission. I fear it will not be enough.\nThough hidden, our arm of the AHA has always been a pillar of New Orleans, Louisiana, and the south itself. I hope some of you will join me in continuing that fight.\nIn Service,\nDr. Elwood Finch\nDirector, American Hunters Association\nChapter 15 🔊 Found Page\nAuthor Unknown\nTorn on the left edge, 5x8 in.\nFor auld lang syne, my dear,\nfor auld lang syne,\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll take a cup of kindness yet\nfor auld lang syne.\nWhen Hell had come like hell we fought,\nregardless of the crime.\nWe take the sin with money got\nfor auld lang syne.\nWe stood as brothers side by side,\nas fires died with time.\nThe devil gone; the heralds sing.\nFor auld lang syne.\nAnd when the fight has come again\nyour gun will become mine!\nFor dead men shall not shoot again.\nFor auld lang syne\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\nand never brought to mind\nShould old acquaintance be forgot\nand auld lang syne?\nYour browser does not support the audio element.

The beta is still free to use, even for commercial purposes: https://ebsynth.com/\nIn the following, I show you how to use EbSynth to create a piece of moving art from a simple video.\nHow to Short overview split video into frames choose a keyframe edit keyframe synth video with EbSynth convert synthed frames back into video Extract frames from video using ffmpeg Get ffmpeg\nFor my video, I chose a framerate of 15 fps. It gives the whole video a feeling of a handdrawn stop motion animation. To split the video into keyframes, I use a simple ffmpeg command. This gives me 15 .png files per every second of video. %03d enumerates the frames from 1 - 999. Because I know approximately how many fames I will get, I know that will be enough. Things of interest:\nimage2 ffmpeg docs examples of image 2 ffmpeg -r 15 -i \u0026#34;[video].mp4\u0026#34; \u0026#34;frames\\frame-%03d.png\u0026#34; Now you have a lot of images to work with: Choosing and editing the keyframe When first using EbSynth, you may find yourself in the situation, that you don\u0026rsquo;t know which frame you should choose for your keyframe. In the FAQ on EbSynth\u0026rsquo;s website, they give you a little help. Start with the first keyframe and synth the video. Watch the video and notice the time, when things start to get weird and don\u0026rsquo;t look as expected. This exact moment is your next keyframe. Take the synthed frame and change it to your liking in an editing software of your choice, then proceed with the new keyfarme.\nI personally like the little drag effects/artefacts that can happen with EbSynth. I take my video shot and choose the frame, which has the most and most important information in it. Since EbSynth can synth forward and backward, it\u0026rsquo;s no problem if your keyframe is e.g. frame-255 and you synth your video from frame-001 to frame-500.\nIn this example, I chose the first frame for my keyfarme, because you can clearly see the full character. The backgroud is less important here. I edited the image to get a washed out, old paper like look:\nRunning EbSynth In EbSynth\u0026rsquo;s gui, you just choose your keyframe and the first of your video frames. After the synthing prozess, you have a folder full of synthed frames:\nConverting frames back into a video For detailled information about this topic, you can read this post from Hammad Mazhar.\nTo get a well formatted H.264/MPEG-4 video, that most players and editing programs can open, I use the following command. You can play with the compression rate (crf) to get the desired result. Lower compression value results in better quality and bigger files.\nffmpeg -r 15 -f image2 -s 1920x1080 -i %03d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p test.mp4 Result Here is the original video compared to the final result:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

To save money, I got a revised one on eBay. After a week of delivery and 2 days in the workshop, the elation of success was immediately followed by great disillusionment. As soon as I turned on the ignition, a strange humming sound came from the engine compartment. On further investigation, the suspicion was confirmed: The boost control does not work.\nI had to find out if the turbo charger was faulty, or my car.\nThe troubleshooting began:\nOil was changed during turbo replacement New oil and air filter was installed DPF was cleaned Voltage supply was checked Signal at boost pressure regulator was checked The error memory was read and the static error code 44CC was found: Boost pressure controller defective Reading the controller signal The reading of the actuator signal was the trickiest part. A test wire was inserted into pin 4 of the turbocharger connector and measured against ground using an oscilloscope.\nThe signal matched the given values from the diganosis manual.\nRemoving the turbo A lot of coolant will spill in the process, so it\u0026rsquo;s much nicer to loosen the bottom screws first. The best way to do this is to jack up the car or drive onto a ramp or lifting platform and remove the underbody cover first.\nLoosen the hose clamps of the turbo oil outlet. Remove the bottom screw of the turbo. Fully open the clamp between the turbo and the catalytic converter. This tends to be tight and can be loosened with a long screwdriver either from below, or from above through the air filter chamber. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to unplug the cable. From there on it continues above. It\u0026rsquo;s annoying, but more or less self-explanatory.\nRemove the plastic covers and the air hose. To remove the air filter cover, you have to remove the dome cross-brace. Next is the egr cooler, this can be a little tricky. 1: there are two torx screws to loosen 2: a long allen screw 3: a short allen screw 4: a not so shot allen screw :P 5: this hose clamp was really thight in my case and needed a lot of wiggeling to get loose 6: I disconnected the hose at the bottom 7, 8: two screws from the air channel At last you have to disconnect the hose at the bottom left. Attention! You need something to seal the hose after removing the egr cooler, because a lot of coolant will come out. Next step is to remove the compressor outlet channel. It\u0026rsquo;s secured with an allen and a torx screw. Before we totaly loosen the turbo, remove the oil intake hose between the engine and the turbo. To loosen the top screws of the turbo, you have to remove 3 little rubber plugs in the air filter housing and the heat shield beneath them. There you find 3 12s double hex screws, which have 50Nm each. There is a little 10 nut on the left side of the turbo that secures another hose. You have to remove that, too. That is it. Your turbo is now free. To get it out, rotate it 180° top to bottom and reverse dive it out.\nTo be continued\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to close this, because it\u0026rsquo;s been a while and my car is doing fine so far with the replaced turbo charger. :)\n","tags":["bmw","turbo"], "section": "blog"},{"date":"1582502400", "url":"https://philippraven.com/blog/arduino/fastpwm/", "title":"Arduino Micro Isp", "summary":"Description A PWM signal is generated at output PB3 without timer prescaler.
